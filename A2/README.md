# ASSIGNMENT 2 - Dynamic Programming

Find the maximum total score that can be obtained by a feasible climbing path.

Given:
* Grid (n x m matrix)
* Start-position is the bottom-left corner (0, 0)
* Only allowed to climb rightwards or upwards
* Moving right costs cr (non-negative int)
* Moving up costs cu (non-negative int)
* Climbing path is feasible if total cost is at most a budget (B)
* Algorithm must take O(nmB) time and space
